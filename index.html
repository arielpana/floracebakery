<p><h2><b>Enteprise Achitecture</b></h2></p>
<li>Often compared with town-planning or urban design, enterprise architecture (EA) is a well-defined practice for conducting enterprise analysis, design, planning, and implementation for the successful development and execution of strategy. Enterprise Architecture reduces redundancy, complexity and information silos and business risks associated with IT investments. Thus, EA provides a blueprint for an effective IT strategy and guides the controlled evolution of IT in a way that delivers business benefit in a cost-effective way.

<p>Practitioners of enterprise architecture, enterprise architects, are responsible for performing the analysis of business structure and processes and are often called upon to draw conclusions from the information collected to address the goals of enterprise architecture: effectiveness, efficiency, agility, and continuity of complex business operations.</p></li>
